            <b>The Adam Project is a 2022 time-travel action film directed by
              Shawn Levy.</b>
            The story is centred on a man who travels back in time and
            accidentally lands in the wrong year and runs into his younger
            self; the two team up to save the future.

            The time travel logic in the film is all over the place, but the
            witty humour keeps the film interesting.

            The film has a big cast with Ryan Reynolds, Jennifer Garner, Zoe
            Saldaña, Mark Ruffalo and Catherine Keener. Walker Scobell has
            done a wonderful job as young Adam

            Sorian is the dad’s partner, and she is funding his research on
            wormholes. This research accidentally leads to the discovery of
            time travel.

            Timeline-1 is not shown in the movie. It appears that once the dad
            died, Sorian was sidelined, and political forces took control of
            the time device.

            Though she was the one who funded the project, she is left with
            nothing. So, at some time in the future in Timeline-1 (perhaps
            2050), Sorian makes an illegal jump to 2018 to meet her self

            Like old Biff in Back To The Future II, old Sorian makes like a
            tree and gets out of there after giving her younger self enough
            stock tips to amass a fortune.

            She also explains how to keep complete control of the Time Program
            by eliminating any political obstacles.

            This information exchange makes way for an altered timeline,
            Timeline-2. Once old Sorian returns to her Fixed Time,

            her memories of a failed life are erased and replaced with ones
            where she is all-powerful. This timeline is the one we see at the
            movie’s beginning.

            In 2050, Laura, who works in the Time Program, notices a log entry
            of Sorian’s jet returning from 2018, but no jet ever left to 2018.

            To investigate, Laura goes back to 2018 to dig deeper.

            Sorian plants an altitude bomb on Laura’s jet. But the bomb goes
            off after Laura reaches 2018, and she manages to eject safely.

            Laura is trapped in the past without her jet and lives her life
            out, hoping and waiting that Adam will come looking for her one
            day.

            In 2050, Sorien announces that Laura died in an accident during
            her re-entry.

            Old Adam smells something fishy about Laura’s death and steals a
            jump jet to go back to 2018 and look for her.

            Unfortunately, he’s shot in the process and enters the wrong time
            coordinates, and lands up in 2022.

            He goes over to the only place he remembers, his old home.

            He confides in young Adam and dresses his wounds. Old Adam’s
            meddling with the past causes a new timeline, Timeline-3.

            Sorian travels to 2022 with a team and arrests old Adam. Laura,
            who’s been living in the past from 2018 to 2022, has constantly
            been scanning for old Adam’s arrival.

            She shows up and helps take down Sorian’s men; they make a run for
            it. Laura explains that the only way they can end the time chaos
            is if old Adam went back to 2018 and stopped time

            travel from being invented. Bang! – that’s the sound of the film
            shooting itself with the Grandfather Paradox. Old Adam doesn’t
            like this idea because

            if they change the stream of time, he and Laura will not meet.
